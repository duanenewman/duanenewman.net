## Duane - The Developer

Duane is Co-Founder of {{< target-blank "Alien Arc Technologies, LLC" "http://www.alienarc.com" >}} where he focuses on creating apps targeting mobile devices, modern desktops, and the Internet of Things. He has a passion for automation and reducing daily friction with software and he strives to bring solutions that improve or eliminate costly duplication and repetitive processes so more important things can be done. 

## Duane - The Community Advocate

Duane enjoys an active role supporting the software development community, both locally, and on the road. In 2014 he offered to help the organizers of the {{< target-blank "Kansas City .NET User Group" "kcdnug.org" >}} and was quickly handed the reigns along with his business partner Brent. As Co-Organizer of the group he helps to coordinate everything from sponsors and venues to speakers and prizes. Duane also began speaking at developer conferences in 2014, with his very first session on Xamarin.Forms at the St. Louis Days of .NET (now Devup). Since that first talk he has grown a lot as a speaker, developer, and conference attendee. He continues to strive to learn more so he can provide relevant and helpful content to attendees. In 2017 his efforts with the developer community were recognized by Microsoft when he was given his first {{< target-blank "MVP Award" "https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002703" >}}, he was re-awarded in 2018.

## Duane - The Diver

In 2015 Duane overcame his fear of the water and became a certified scuba diver. In 2018, over 125 dives after getting started, he completed his PADI Instructor Exam and can now be found sharing his love of the underwater world as a PADI Open Water Scuba Instructor. He loves helping others overcome their own challenges and is inspired by those moments when students eyes light up when they realize they are actually breathing underwater, or see aquatic life in a new way, from below the surface for the first time. If you ever get tired of talking tech at a conference find him and ask him about scuba, but make sure you have plenty of free time.
