Whether you are creating an open source library or building enterprise app core components, you need to get that functionality into other projects. But developing these resources is usually easier than consuming them. How about a worry free way to distribute and reference those resources in your project that will let you stay up to date, but allow you to avoid problems that may introduce breaking changes or new bugs? NuGet packages to the rescue! We'll also take a look at where you can find NuGet (packages aren't just for code any more) and how to create, distribute, and maintain your very own package. Then, you’ll be ready to share your package with your team, your enterprise, or even… The world! 

## Learning Objectives

* Understanding the many ways to create a NuGet package, both with VS and NuGet command line
* Understanding versioning concerns, especially around a public package
* Understand things you can do to make your public packages self-documenting and ease new dev adoption
