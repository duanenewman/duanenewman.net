Working with delegates in C# is easier than ever with .NET's generic Action and Func types. Understanding .NET delegates is key to harnessing the power of language features like Lambdas and LINQ. In this session, we'll dig into delegates, exploring what they are, how they work, and how they can help you be a SOLID developer. Don't let delegates put you in a Func, take Action, and learn how to make your code simpler, cleaner, and more flexible.

## Learning Objectives

* Understanding Delegates, in their many forms, and how to use Lambdas
* Ability to take advantage of Action and Func when utilizing delegates in code
* Ability to use Delegates and Lambdas to unlock the potential of LINQ
