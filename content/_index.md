**Hi, I’m Duane.**
I build software, teach developers, support the tech community, and help people learn how to breathe underwater.

I’m a long-time software developer who loves learning and sharing the technologies that excite me. You’ll usually find me:

* [**Speaking**](Speaking) at conferences, user groups, and local events
* Co-organizing the **{{< target-blank "Kansas City .NET User Group" "http://kcdnug.org" >}}**
* Providing hands-on technical [**training**](training)
* Writing about software, tooling, and lessons learned on my [**blog**](blog)
* Sharing projects and experiments on **{{< target-blank "GitHub" "https://github.com/duanenewman" >}}**

Microsoft has recognized my ongoing involvement in the developer community with the **{{< target-blank "MVP Award" "https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/55669ea3-f35a-e711-8114-3863bb2ed1f8" >}}**, which I’ve been honored to receive every year since 2017.

I don’t just geek out over software.

In 2015, I fell in love with scuba diving, and today I teach others as a PADI & SDI certified Scuba Instructor through **{{< target-blank "Dive Rinse Repeat Scuba" "https://drrscuba.com" >}}**. Helping people overcome fear and experience the underwater world for the first time is one of the most rewarding things I do.
