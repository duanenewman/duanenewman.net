<p>This was my first year speaking at the Heartland Developers Conference in Omaha, although I’ve attended many times through the years as an attendee. The experience was quite a lot of fun, and I had a good time hanging out with old friends and making a few new ones. My wife came with me and good time watching all of us “geeks” hangout. </p>  <p>This was the first time doing a new talk, and the first talk that didn’t involve any demo’s, and it was not scheduled until Friday morning. Needless to say I spent a lot of time fretting about the talk and was constantly tweaking my slides. The talk itself went really well, the audience was very involved with a lot of great questions. My talk was on DevOps and I brought to light the importance and advantages of getting a DevOps friendly environment established. I was happy to see I had a mix of developers, IT guys and managers as I really tried to target the talk to a broad audience. All-in-all I’m looking forward to what HDC might bring next year.</p>  <p><img title="Duane presenting at HDC15" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; max-width:100%; max-height:100%;" border="0" alt="Duane presenting at HDC15" src="/img/posts/0X1A0827.jpg"></p>
