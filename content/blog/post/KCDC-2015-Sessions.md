<p>KCDC is just a week away and I'm busy updating my materials. I'm looking forward to meeting some great developers and catching up with what is quickly becoming a close group of speaker friends.</p>  <p>I'll be presenting my Xamarin.Forms talk on Thursday morning at 10:10 AM. Conference mornings are always a little rough, but I like getting the talk done early, then I get to relax, network, and enjoy seeing my friends presenting their talks. If you are looking at doing mobile development and have a solid C# background then I encourage you to attend my session.</p>  <p>Even better than a 1 hour session, you could attend the full day workshop that Brent and I are doing on Wednesday. This will be our first time doing a workshop. I'll be honest, it is a little scary committing to a whole day. There is a lot of pressure to do well. We want to give a workshop that will be both interesting and instructive. I think we have managed to come up with something everyone will enjoy.</p>  <p>I'm looking forward to seeing you all there!</p>
