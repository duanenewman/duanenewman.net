<p>I’ve been wanting to start speaking at conferences for a while now, but have always been nervous about it. I’ve really wanted to do this for a long time but I specifically remember in 2013 I went to KCDC and was all energized about sharing as a speaker. I decided that I was going to work on having a presentation for the next year. When KCDC 2014 was announced earlier this year I realized I hadn’t even thought about a topic since the week after last years conference. I was a little bummed by my lack of effort, to say the least.</p>  <p>This was all happening about the time that I was seriously thinking about going out on my own. While I wasn’t prepared to talk at KCDC I knew that I still really wanted to make it happen. </p>  <p>Fast forward to May when Brent and I started working through our new company on our first contract. With the change from employee to business co-founder I knew that it now meant even more to me and my business to be involved. Right after this I met some great speakers at KCDC that really encouraged me to put myself out there and do it. I also heard good things about St. Louis Days of .NET and about a month after KCDC the call for speakers went out for St. Louis.</p>  <p>I didn’t have a presentation started, but I had one I been thinking about and I knew that if I waited for the presentation to be “done” I would never start speaking. So, I took the plunge, wrote my abstract, hit submit, and freaked out a little. It wasn’t long before the selection process was done and I received (and accepted) an invitation to present a session at St. Louis. I freaked out a lot.</p>  <p>I had picked a technology that I was beginning to use with my business but that I didn’t yet have a lot of experience in. I did this partly because I knew having to present on it would push me to really understand it, and because it was new and cool.</p>  <p>The experience has been both exciting and nerve-racking, but one I think will have a rewarding end. I’m pumped to complete the presentation and do the talk, and the date is fast approaching.</p>  <p>I’ll blog more about the process I’ve been going through to prepare for this talk in the coming weeks as I begin to put the finishing touches on it before the big day.</p>
