Let's take Xamarin.Forms beyond Hello World and explore how to create apps that adapt to your users devices in the real-world. As an app developer, you don't want your apps to just look great in portrait or landscape on a phone, you want to provide a larger display experience option. In this session we will build an app that spans platforms and device types, giving users a rich experience , regardless of platform or form factor. Stop making ugly one-layout-fits-all UI apps, and start making single code-base apps your users love! Everybody wins!

## Learning Objectives

* The ability to plan UI design around changing form factors
* Understanding how to implement this adaptive UI design in Xamarin Forms
* Understanding the impact on user experience when using smaller (or larger) form factor devices

## Level: Intermediate
