<p>Back in November 2014 at the <a href="http://stldodn.com/" target="_blank">St. Louis Days of .NET</a> conference I sat down with JJ Hammond from <a href="http://stltechtalk.com/" target="_blank">STL Tech Talk</a> for an interview. It was a lot of fun and I had a great time talking about Xamarin, Xamarin.Forms, and mobile development for the C# developer. It got lost somewhere among all the other interview videos, but thanks to Kevin and JJ it is was found and is now posted for your viewing pleasure. </p>  <p>This was recorded November 14, 2014 just a couple days after Microsoft made its announcement about open sourcing the .NET framework in conjunction with Xamarin announcing support for the Community Edition of Visual Studio and expanded functionality for their Starter license.</p>  <p><a title="Duane Newman - St. Louis Days of .NET 2014" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6YSNvWQJfU&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Duane Newman - St. Louis Days of .NET 2014</a></p>
