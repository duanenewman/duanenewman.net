<p>It was a pleasure to attend and speak at Nebraska.Code() this year. The guys in Lincoln are great and really put on a good conference. One of the neat parts of being a speaker is getting to know a lot of other great speakers as you go from one conference to another together. I've found that as soon as one conference is over I'm looking forward to the next one and the chance to hang out with the gang.</p>  <p>One of the highlights of the conference was meeting and getting to know Richard Campbell and Carl Franklin. After listening to the .NET Rocks! podcast for so long it was cool to watch them actually record some episodes. What impressed me was how they were just a couple of regular guys (sure, Richard likes to tell a lot of stories, but he is good at it, and they were always entertaining). They were a lot of fun to hang with and I hope to see them at another conference soon.</p>  <p>My session went well and now that I've given it a few times and had more exposure speaking I felt my delivery was good. I had an early scare preparing for the talk, something happened to my local android SDK (and by something I mean I wasn't thinking and updated the SDK outside of Xamarin's installer) so I had a late evening trying to figure it out. Fortunately an uninstall of the SDK and reinstall using Xamarin's installer and all was right in the world. One day I'll learn not to muck with anything on my system anywhere near a conference. </p>  <p>Speaking has been one of the most enjoyable things I've done in a while and I'm looking forward to more opportunities (catch me at KCDC in June). I'm starting to think about adding a new talk for future conferences.. maybe something in the DevOps world.</p>
