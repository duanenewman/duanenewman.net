Join me on a journey through the development of a real app using Xamarin.Forms, Azure Functions & Storage, third party integrations, and more. Instead of showing you "Hello World" or some contrived app that doesn't show how things work in the real world, I'll show you examples from a system built for our Kansas City .NET User Group as an extension to Meetup. We'll explore real challenges, such as authenticating with third party providers, caching data locally for offline use, cross-platform UI, and more. I'll also show you how you can use this open source project for your community.

## Level: Introductory
