## tl;dr;

I’m Duane. I build software so people don’t have to do the same thing twice. I teach developers so they don’t have to learn everything the hard way. I teach scuba so people can overcome fears and breathe underwater. One of those is objectively cooler.

## Duane - The Developer

I’ve been building software professionally since 1997, starting with Visual Basic and eventually finding my happy place in the modern .NET ecosystem. Over the years I’ve worked across desktop, web, mobile, and IoT, using technologies like C#, SQL, JavaScript, and XAML to create clean, maintainable, human-friendly systems. These days, I spend most of my time in C# and .NET, building modern apps with MAUI and Blazor that feel fast, intentional, and a pleasure to use.

In 2014, I co-founded {{< target-blank "Alien Arc Technologies, LLC" "https://alienarc.com" >}}, a software consultancy where I focus on designing and delivering modern applications that reduce duplication, automate repetitive processes, and lower daily friction for teams. I’m a firm believer that if something has to be done more than twice, software should probably be doing it for you.

## Duane - The Community Advocate

I care deeply about the developer community and have spent years giving back through user groups, mentoring, and conference speaking. I began helping organize the {{< target-blank "Kansas City .NET User Group" "https://kcdnug.org" >}} in 2014 and quickly became a co-organizer, handling everything from speakers and sponsors to venues and logistics.

That same year, I started speaking at conferences, with my first talk focused on Xamarin.Forms. Since then, I’ve presented across the U.S. and internationally, continually refining my craft and learning alongside the communities I serve. In 2017, Microsoft recognized these efforts with my first {{< target-blank "MVP Award" "https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002703" >}}, an honor I’ve been grateful to receive every year since.

Do you want to become a conference speaker too? Reach out to us at the {{< target-blank "KCDNUG" "https://kcdnug.org" >}}, we'd love to help you get started with a low-pressure talk.

## Duane - The SCUBA Diver

In 2015, I did something that shocked my family and surprised even me... I became a scuba diver despite a lifelong fear of the water. A few years (and 125+ dives) later, I earned my PADI Instructor certification. In 2020, my wife Lisa and I opened a dive shop, {{< target-blank "Dive Rinse Repeat Scuba" "https://drrscuba.com" >}}, where I now teach as both a PADI and SDI scuba instructor.

Helping students overcome fear, build confidence, and experience the underwater world for the first time is one of the most rewarding things I do. If you ever get tired of talking tech, ask me about scuba — just don’t do it if you’re in a hurry.
