<p>I just picked up my Surface Pro from my local Microsoft Store this morning. I&rsquo;m no stranger to Windows 8; I&rsquo;ve been using it on my desktop since RTM (and a little before) and I bought the RT back on launch day. In general I like the changes that have been made and no longer feel at home on Windows 7. I have especially been digging the way the interface was built around touch with my RT, I think that has helped me accept some of the changes experienced with mouse and keyboard only input.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered the convenience that is OneNote for all my meeting and personal notes. I had seen OneNote but never really tried it until I had my RT. Being able to take quick notes on my Surface in a meeting or on the go and then review or edit them on my desktop is awesome. The only thing I&rsquo;ve really been missing is the ability to have useful pen input. I&rsquo;ve tried capacitive touch pens in the past (I bought an iPad with a Pogo pen thinking I finally had a digital notebook) but the &ldquo;pen&rdquo; input was all next to useless or tedious to input (had to use a special part of the screen, or zoom in and write real big) and not very effective for non-continuous strokes like sketching a diagram where lines connect.</p>
<p>One of the things that excited me about the Surface Pro was a built in digitizer. I&rsquo;ve been down to the MS store a few times over the last couple months and have looked at some of the other Win 8 Pro devices with pen input and while they were nice they just didn&rsquo;t feel quite there. The pen input would lag significantly behind where you were writing unless you went very slow.</p>
<p>Enter the Surface Pro. I got to get my hands on it earlier this week and play around for a while. The pen input is awesome. It stays right there with the pen unless I&rsquo;m obviously trying to get ahead (faster than I&rsquo;d ever reasonably use the pen) zipping across the screen.</p>
<p>I had been using the touch cover with my RT and opted for the type cover for this unit. So far I really like the type cover, it seems more accurate and I appreciate the tactile feedback letting me know I really did press the key.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still getting everything installed and will report back on my continued experience, but for someone who doesn&rsquo;t really need a laptop, but wants the convenience of still having a real PC, this is great.</p>
