In this session we will take a look at how AutoFixture can simplify the arranging and asserting portions of your .NET unit tests. We'll explore how it integrates with mocking libraries to allow you to easily write tests and have dependency types automatically mocked and injected into your object under test. We'll also look at how AutoFixture can be extended and customized to make you more productive with your domain specific types. Why build your own mocks or create custom fakes when AutoFixture can do it for you?
