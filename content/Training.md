I love learning new things — and even more, I love helping teams apply what I’ve learned in real projects.

## Training

If your developers need to level up quickly, I offer custom, in-house training designed around your team, your codebase, and your goals. These are hands-on workshops (full-day or multi-day) focused on practical skills your team can use immediately.

Training topics include:
* Fundamentals of Modern .NET & C#
* XAML-based UI development (MAUI, WPF, WinUI)
* Cross-Platform Mobile application development
* ASP.NET and backend services
* DevOps fundamentals for small and mid-sized teams

With years of experience supporting real production systems, I also help teams get comfortable with the operational side of software development — including CI/CD, automation, and deployment strategies using tools like PowerShell, Octopus Deploy, and Azure DevOps.

## Project Kick-Start

Sometimes training alone isn’t enough. If you’re starting a new project — or struggling to gain momentum — a Project Kick-Start can help you move forward with confidence.

My team and I can embed with your developers for as little as a few weeks, or as long as it takes to get your MVP launched. We’ll help you:
* Establish a clear architecture and technical direction
* Set up continuous integration and automated deployments
* Ensure your team understands why decisions were made
* Leave you with working systems, not just slides

When we step away, your team is equipped to continue independently, with a solid foundation and a clear path to production.
