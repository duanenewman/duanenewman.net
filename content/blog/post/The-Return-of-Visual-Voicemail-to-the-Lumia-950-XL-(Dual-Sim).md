<p>For those that purchased an unlocked Lumia 950 XL from Microsoft in the last few months and have been frustrated at the lack of Visual Voice (that’s everyone who bought one) you can rejoice. Last week I had sketchy WiFi access so I just discovered that I had an update available last night. When I went to take a look at the change log I discovered this little gem:</p>  <ul>   <li>Support for Visual Voicemail on Dual SIM phones </li> </ul>  <p>It sounds like this has been available in the Windows Insiders build for a little while, but I’ve been hesitant to put my primary phone on the insiders builds. So I didn’t realize it was in the wild.. If I had I might have bit the bullet and jumped on the fast ring.</p>  <p>The lack of Visual Voicemail on my Lumia 950 XL was pretty frustrating and nearly had me returning it to the Microsoft Store.. It definitely had me hesitant to recommend it to anyone not technical. While it may seem like a little thing to miss, it is one of those advances in user interface that makes the old way not just unpleasant, but feel archaic. I found out after I got my 950 XL that the missing feature was a known issue on previous Dual Sim windows phones, but the presentation of the 950 XL as Microsoft’s flagship phone made it seem like a total oversight. I’m glad to see it fixed and will happily recommend the 950 XL to anyone looking for a top of the line Windows Phone.</p>  <p>For more details on this update you can checkout this post on the Microsoft Answers site: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdupdate/announcement-april-cumulative-update-for-windows/bf3c485b-794a-4b60-b7a8-9edec3104b9d?auth=1" target="_blank">Announcement: April Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Mobile (brings phone to 10586.218)</a></p>
